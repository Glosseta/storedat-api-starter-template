# Stordat API Starter

Unleash the power of Web3 storage with a single GraphQL API over decentralized storage providers like Arweave and Filecoin.  [Storedat API](https://storedat.io) is one of the easiest ways to start using decentralized web3 storage without the hassle of managing wallets, signing for transactions, paying for uploads, etc..

Use this starter template repo to get going with the [Storedat API](https://storedat.io).  You can use it to give you an example of how to integrate the API into your app or you can even use it as a base for your own project!

## How to get started

1. Pull the code or fork the code to your computer
2. Run `yarn` to download the dependencies
3. Run `yarn generate-gql` to download and create the Storedat GraphQL types
4. Run `yarn dev` to run the app

## Endpoints to try out

After you run the app successfully, try hitting the following endpoints to get a feel how to work with the API

1. Get Glossary term : [http://localhost:3000/api/get-glossary-term](http://localhost:3000/api/get-glossary-term)
2. Get Data from Filecoin : [http://localhost:3000/api/get-filecoin-data](http://localhost:3000/api/get-filecoin-data)
3. 2. Get Data from Arweave : [http://localhost:3000/api/get-arweave-data](http://localhost:3000/api/get-arweave-data)
